## 1. Before You Submit — Best Practices

Google's official best practices before any submission:

- Read and understand all Chrome Web Store policies **before** building.
- Your extension must add genuine value — if it isn't useful or unique, it
  doesn't belong on the store.
- No cheating: misleading users, copying other developers' work, or
  manipulating ratings/reviews results in a **permanent ban**.
- Carefully follow the data collection and disclosure requirements (see §3).
- Keep all listing metadata (description, screenshots, privacy fields)
  accurate and up to date at all times.
- Test for crashes, broken features, and bugs before every submission.
- Verify your developer account email is active — enforcement emails require
  timely action; failing to respond can result in removal.
- Include a clear description of your extension's **single purpose** in the
  designated field.
- Policies can change at any time. Google notifies developers via email, and
  compliance with updated policies is the developer's responsibility.

## 2. Fostering a Safe Ecosystem

### 2.1 Mature & Sexually Explicit Content

- No nudity, graphic sex acts, sexually explicit material, or links to
  pornography sites.
- Zero tolerance for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) — reported to
  authorities and account deleted immediately.
- Non-sexual nudity (artistic, educational, scientific) may be allowed but
  can reduce store visibility.
- Content not suitable for all ages must be marked **Mature** in the
  Developer Dashboard.

### 2.2 Malicious and Prohibited Products

- No viruses, worms, Trojan horses, malware, or destructive code of any kind.
- No content that harms Google's or third-party networks/servers/infrastructure.
- Spyware, malicious scripts, and phishing scams are prohibited.
- Do not circumvent paywalls or login restrictions on external websites.
- Do not facilitate unauthorized download or streaming of copyrighted content.
- Cryptocurrency mining is not allowed.

### 2.3 Hate Speech and Violent Behavior

- No gratuitous violence, threats, harassment, or bullying.
- No content that incites hatred based on race, ethnicity, religion,
  disability, gender, age, veteran status, nationality, sexual orientation,
  gender identity, or any similarly protected characteristic.
- Extensions that recruit, fundraise for, or promote violence on behalf of
  extremist groups are removed immediately.

### 2.4 Regulated Goods and Services

- No promotion or facilitation of illegal activities.
- **Real money gambling is explicitly prohibited** (casinos, sports betting,
  lotteries, skill-prize games). Simulated gambling with no real-money prizes
  may be allowed with clear disclosure.
- No facilitation of sales of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, tobacco, fireworks,
  weapons, or health/medical devices.

## 3. Protecting User Privacy

### 3.1 Privacy Policy

- **Required** if your extension handles any user data.
- Must comprehensively disclose how data is collected, used, and shared, and
  list all third parties data is shared with.
- Must be linked in the designated Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard field.

### 3.2 Limited Use

- You must limit data use to the practices disclosed.
- Collection of web browsing activity is prohibited unless it is required
  for a prominently described user-facing feature.
- User data obtained for one purpose must only be used to provide or improve
  that single purpose. Specifically prohibited:
  - Selling data to advertising platforms or data brokers.
  - Using data for personalized ads.
  - Using data to determine credit-worthiness.
  - Transferring data for any reason not listed in the policy.
- If your extension accesses Google APIs, you must publish a statement on your
  website affirming compliance with Limited Use requirements.

### 3.3 Minimum Permissions

- Request the **narrowest permissions** necessary. If two permissions could
  accomplish the same thing, use the one with the least access.
- Do not "future-proof" by requesting permissions for features not yet built.

### 3.4 Disclosure & Consent

- Be transparent about all data handling.
- If data collected is not closely related to the prominently described
  functionality, you must:
  1. Prominently disclose what data is collected and how it will be used.
  2. Obtain affirmative, informed user consent **before** installation.

### 3.5 Data Security

- Handle all user data securely and transmit via modern cryptography.
- Never publicly disclose financial, payment, or authentication information.
- Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited must be addressed; Google
  may remove the extension until remediation steps are completed.

## 4. Responsible Marketing & Monetization

### 4.1 Impersonation & Intellectual Property

- Do not impersonate another company or claim official authorization you
  don't have.
- Do not mimic OS or browser functionality/warnings.
- Do not create sites that mimic or pass themselves off as the Chrome Web Store.
- No false metadata ("Editor's Choice", "Number One", etc.).
- Do not infringe on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or copyrights.

### 4.2 Deceptive Installation Tactics

The following are prohibited and will result in removal:

- Misleading ads or marketing materials that don't accurately describe the
  extension.
- Misleading call-to-action buttons or forms that hide the fact that an
  extension will be installed.
- Manipulating the store listing window to hide metadata from users.
- Bundling other extensions or offers in the same installation flow.
- Requiring unrelated user actions to access advertised functionality.

### 4.3 Accepting Payments

- Collect financial information securely in accordance with privacy laws and
  PCI standards.
- Clearly describe what you are selling and post terms of sale prominently.
- If the extension requires payment for basic functionality, state this
  clearly in the description.
- Clearly identify yourself — not Google — as the seller.

### 4.4 Misleading or Unexpected Behavior

- No deceptive content in titles, descriptions, icons, or screenshots.
- Device settings changes must have user knowledge and consent, and be
  easily reversible.
- Do not include hidden functionality unrelated to the primary purpose.
- No impossible claimed features (e.g. "see who viewed your profile").

### 4.5 Ads

- Ads must comply with all content policies.
- AdSense may **not** be used in extensions.
- Ads must be clearly labeled with their source.
- Ads must be easily removable by the user.
- Ads must not simulate system notifications or warnings.
- Forcing users to click ads or submit personal information to use the
  extension is prohibited.
- Ads must not interfere with ads or native content on third-party websites
  unless all four conditions are met: disclosed to the user, clearly
  attributed, non-interfering, and non-impersonating.

### 4.6 Affiliate Ads

- Affiliate programs must be prominently described in the store listing, UI,
  and before installation.
- Affiliate links/codes/cookies may only be included when the extension
  provides a direct, transparent user benefit tied to its core functionality.
- User action is required before each affiliate code, link, or cookie is
  applied. Silent background injection is a violation.

## 5. Building Quality Products

### 5.1 Featured Products

The following types of products are eligible for the store but will **not** be
featured in curated collections:

- Religious or political content
- VPNs
- Video downloaders
- Anti-virus tools
- Content not suitable for all families
- Bots
- Cryptocurrency tools
- Non-production builds
- Gambling content
- Extensions from developers with a history of misleading or malicious products

### 5.2 Spam and Abuse

- Do not publish multiple extensions that duplicate the same experience.
- Do not manipulate ratings, reviews, or install counts (no incentivized or
  fraudulent downloads/reviews).
- No notification abuse: no spam, ads, promotions, phishing, or unwanted
  messages via extension notifications.
- Do not send messages on behalf of the user without confirmation of content
  and recipients.
- Must comply with Google's Webmaster Quality Guidelines.

### 5.3 Single Purpose / Quality Guidelines

- An extension must have **one narrow, clearly understood purpose**.
- Do not bundle unrelated features. If two features are clearly separate,
  they should be separate extensions.
- Persistent UI elements should actively enhance the user's current task
  with minimal distraction.
- Violations include: side panels that hijack browsing, extensions whose
  primary purpose is serving ads, toolbars with a broad array of unrelated
  functionality.

### 5.4 Listing Requirements

- A blank description, missing icon, or missing screenshots results in
  **automatic rejection**.
- All listing metadata must be accurate, up to date, and comprehensive.
- Privacy fields in the dashboard must match your privacy policy and actual
  extension behavior.
- No keyword spam: do not stuff irrelevant or excessive keywords, lists of
  brands/regions, or repetitions of the same keyword more than 5 times.
- No anonymous or unattributed user testimonials in the description.

### 5.5 Minimum Functionality

- Do not publish an extension whose sole purpose is launching another app,
  theme, webpage, or extension.
- No broken functionality (dead links, non-functioning features).
- Must provide genuine utility. Violations include: extensions with no
  functionality, extensions that only redirect to an external service, and
  click-bait template extensions with negligible unique value.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Code Readability

- Code must not be **obfuscated** or have its functionality concealed. This
  includes external code fetched by the extension.
- Minification **is** allowed: removing whitespace/comments, shortening
  variable names, collapsing files.

### 6.2 API Use

- Extensions must use existing Chrome APIs for their intended use cases. Using
  unofficial methods where an API exists is a violation.
- Example: overriding the New Tab page through any means other than the URL
  Overrides API is not permitted.

### 6.3 Manifest V3 Requirements

- The full functionality of an MV3 extension must be discernible from its
  submitted code — logic must be self-contained.
- The extension may reference external **data/resources**, but external
  resources must not contain any logic.
- Prohibited:
  - `<script>` tags pointing to resources outside the extension package.
  - `eval()` or equivalent to execute remotely fetched strings.
  - Interpreters for commands fetched from a remote source.
- Permitted remote execution only via officially documented APIs:
  - Debugger API
  - User Scripts API
- Communicating with remote servers is still allowed for: account sync,
  remote config (where all logic is local), non-logic resources (images),
  and server-side operations on data.

### 6.4 2-Step Verification (2SV)

- **Mandatory** for all developer accounts before publishing or updating
  any extension. Enable at: <https://myaccount.google.com/security>

| Serious violation | Extension immediately taken down, developer notified |
| Extreme issue (malware) | Immediately taken down, developer **not** notified |

### 7.3 Appeals

- Developers may appeal a violation decision **once**.
- After the appeal decision, no further appeals are accepted for that violation.
- Frivolous or bad-faith appeals may result in forfeiture of future appeal rights.

### 7.4 Repeat Abuse

- Serious or repeated violations result in **suspension of the developer
  account** and possibly related accounts.
- Repeated IP infringement (copyright) results in account termination.
- Extreme cases may result in suspension of associated Google services.

### 7.5 Enforcement Circumvention

- Any attempt to circumvent limitations or enforcement results in **immediate
  termination** of the developer account.

## 9. Common Rejection Reasons

Based on official documentation and developer community reports:

| Reason | How it applies to Novel Dialogue Enhancer |
|---|---|
| **Broad host permissions** | ⚠️ `optional_host_permissions: ["*://*/*"]` is present — justify clearly in description and explain it is user-initiated for custom sites only |
| **Missing description or icon** | Easy to fix before submission |
| **Keyword spam in description** | Avoid repeating "novel", "dialogue", "AI", "Ollama" excessively |
| **Privacy field mismatch** | Ensure dashboard privacy fields match the README/policy: local-only storage, no external data transfer |
| **Obfuscated code** | Not applicable — unminified source is included; minified files are produced from it |
| **Remote code execution** | Not applicable — no `eval()`, all logic runs locally; Ollama is a localhost service, not a remote server |
| **Misleading functionality claims** | Describe DOM injection as "best-effort"; novel-site markup may change and affect detection accuracy |
| **Single purpose violation** | ✅ Extension has one clear purpose: enhancing translated novel dialogue using a local LLM |
| **Deceptive install tactics** | N/A — no ads or install funnels |
| **localhost host permission** | `http://localhost:11434/*` may prompt additional review — explain in the listing that it is required to communicate with the user's local Ollama instance |

---

## 10. Practical Tips for Faster Review

- **Justify `optional_host_permissions`.** The `*://*/*` optional permission
  is a known scrutiny trigger. State clearly in the description that it is
  only requested when the user manually adds a custom site in the Options page,
  and that the default experience uses only the 13 listed sites.
- **Explain the localhost permission.** `http://localhost:11434/*` is
  unusual; reviewers may flag it. Include a brief note in the listing that
  the extension requires a locally installed copy of Ollama — no data
  leaves the user's machine.
- **Include unminified source.** The package ships both `*.min.js` (used at
  runtime) and the original `*.js` sources, making it trivial for reviewers
  to verify that the minified code is not obfuscated.
- **Accurate metadata.** Mismatches between the listing and actual behavior
  are a top reason for rejection and re-review.
- **Review times vary.** Most submissions complete in under 24 hours; 90%
  within 3 days. Extensions with sensitive permissions (like broad optional
  host permissions) may take longer. If pending for more than 3 weeks,
  contact developer support.
- **Don't re-submit immediately after rejection.** Fix the flagged issues
  first; re-submitting without changes can extend review time.
- **30-day publish window.** After approval, you have 30 days to publish
  before the submission reverts to draft and requires re-review.
- **Enable email notifications** in the Developer Dashboard Account page to
  receive publish and stage notifications (rejection/takedown emails are
  enabled by default).
