**Effective Date:** 2025-05-17

Thank you for using **Novel Dialogue Enhancer** (the "Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension collects and how it is used.

## 1. Information Collection

The Extension **does not collect**, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data to external servers.

The Extension operates entirely within your browser and processes data locally on your device.

Specifically:

- The Extension accesses the content of web pages you visit **only to enhance dialogue for supported novel websites**.
- Any text processing (e.g. fixing pronouns or making dialogue more natural) occurs **locally in your browser**.
- No browsing history, credentials, or personally identifiable data is collected or sent externally.
- The Extension uses the `storage` permission to save your feature preferences locally in Chrome's extension storage.

## 2. Third-Party Services

This extension may optionally connect to a **locally-hosted service at `http://localhost:11434`** to enhance processing functionality. This service runs on your machine and does not involve third-party cloud services.

The Extension does not integrate with or send data to external third-party APIs or services by default.

## 3. Permissions Explanation

The following permissions are used:

- `activeTab` – to access the currently active tab for processing novel content.
- `storage` – to save your extension settings and preferences.
- `scripting` – to dynamically inject scripts required for enhancement.
- `host_permissions` – to access specific novel websites for processing.
- `optional_host_permissions` – to allow you to manually enable enhancement on other websites.

These permissions are solely used to improve the functionality and customization of the extension. No external data collection occurs.

## 4. User Control
